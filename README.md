# Wiener-degradation-models-with-scale-mixture-normal-distributed-measurement-errors-for-RUL-predictio
Part of the code to my publication, including the core algorithm and part of visualization. In the original paper, four distributions with different updating procedures are implemented </br>
## Student t+b change.R
This is the core algorithm, including basic EM algorithm, Variational Bayesian method, accelerated EM algorithm, RUL prediction, time-scale updating.
## Data Analysis_Simulation.R
This is the visulization scripts, achieved mainly based on ggplot package.
